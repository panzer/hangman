# Hangman

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.3.

Developed entirely by Matt Panzer! My first ever Angular project!

Based on the classic paper and pencil [Hangman game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)).

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Tests

Tests are currently not setup properly. :pensive: This could be done later.
